# Welcome!

I'm Trever Ehrfurth, a full time data engineer by trade, and a homelab enthusiast for fun. I enjoy learning new tools and technologies, automation, developing pipelines, and building cool stuff. I am an open source advocate and contributor and enjoy working with passionate developers to create better tools. 

I hope you find something helpful here and that we can enjoy this learning journey together!
